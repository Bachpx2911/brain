title: Using emoji to substitute a href link
---

Sample syntax: [word]ðŸ¥²[url]

Somehow I feel this takes longer to type. We must press Ctrl+Cmd+Space for emoji board, while <a href> can be type directly from the keyboard. Programming [[language]] supposed to be concise, but it somehow needs the explicit factor.
	
Seems more like a hobby move and might be adopted by small groups, but not scalable. Personally I still prefer everything built on Markdown-based or some shorten syntaxes.

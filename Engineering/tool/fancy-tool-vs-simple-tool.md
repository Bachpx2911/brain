### The abstract 
- Writing tools with helful GUI like Notion/ Coda makes the writing habit easier. However, they failed to help writers memorize the core information.
- Fancy tools with helpful buttons and pre-set plugins is wya more convenient, yet it reduces the will to understand how something operates. They shift their focus to getting the job done. And gradually moving away from actually grasp the mechanism. 

### Point of view
`silver bullet` â€“ something to make software costs drop as rapidly as computer hardware costs do

The essential difficulty in software made from the three aspects: complexity (the ability to change and adapt), conformity (the standardize principles), changability (the subjection of change based on society factors) and invisibility. 

Software (*and everything for that matters*) scales up. We change accordingly. There's no silver bullet in software engineering. And neither does one size fits all solution.

Each type of tool serves a different purpose. Fancy tool can help resolve an issue quickly due to the `helpful` factor. But in term of thoroughly understanding how something works at its core, simple tool seems to be a good fit. 

I'd prefer simple tool over the fancy ones. `Helping` too much result to no human's effort. You may get the job done, but you have no idea hwo it got there. 

### To sum up
- Fancy tools = 'helpful'
- Simple tool = 'make you think'

# The Dwarves Brainery

Welcome to the Dwarves Brainery. Dwarves are a group of technology innovation advocates. This project is a part of our continuous learning engine, where we want to build up the 1% improvement every day.

We believe that behind every success comes great preparation, accumulate and compound every single day. This repo equivalent to our study and hard work for any upcoming opportunity.

Applying the Zettelkasten method to build up our reference neuron network, we collect learning pieces from articles, books, papers and then put them here to evaluate before boarding them to our technology adoption radar.

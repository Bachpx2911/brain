title: Simple explanation on Text editor and IDE
---

In common: Writing [[tool]] for developers, but each has specific goal during development phase. 

- IDE: For executing, debugging and testing while writing your codes. IDE usually comes with automation building and console executing that suitable for backend programming.

- Text Editor: A `note pad` for developers, write, edit and format their code with no debugging support. Lightweight and easy to setup.Text Editor tends to execute a `webpage`, which is perfectly used for blog or static page that requires built-version once there's an update on content. 

Which to choose?
Again, depends on the language you're using and developmental goals. 

My advice? Text Editor as beginners, then IDE once you're ready to build something on your own.

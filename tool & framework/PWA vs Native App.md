title: Progressive Web App <> Native App
---

`progressive` in PWA stands for the *progressive* enhancement - to bring a better native-like experience for users. It looks and performs like mobile applications, but through a [[browser]].

[[PWA vs Native App]] helps save time (for user) and cost (for developer). User can directly experience the app through browser, yet no need to download the [[appplication]].

Benefit of PWA (progressive web app) in E-commerce: https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/pwa/#benefits-of-progressive-web-apps. We'd prefer to buy stuffs directly without download the application. A splendid way to drive sale. 

Does it go against Native App? 
Not really. PWA somehow helps turn the first-time user into loyal customer. Once they've decided to explore more, it's the place where Native App dives in.

title: Remove UTM tracking
---

Ever wonder why the current URL on your [[browser]] is too long and contain too many letters? Here's a fact, most of them are *tracking code*. 

It makes the URL looks clumsy, and unprofessional. It's hard for recipients to recognize what the link was about. Most of the time I copy a link then drop it to someone else, I often shorten them with URL Shortener/ bit.ly. 

ClearURL comes to the rescue. It removes tracking element on your [[website]], clear your internet trace mark, blocks ad domains and prevent ETag tracking (*i.e. how many times you visit a website*).

Removing UTM also a method for [[privacy]] protection.

title: From Monolith to Service oriented
---

When it comes to [[architecture]] design, [[Monolith]] is fater in early iteration, but it gets slower over time. In monolith, changes require a full build. Thats a pain in the ass with big teams. 

SOA is basically the same with [[microservices]], provides scaling opportunity. It serves multiple purposes, independently. 

Imo, when it comes to architectural decision, it should depends on the phase - [[software development]] phase. In short, does the codebase small enough to manage as a whole, or should it be divided into smaller blocks?

More to read : [Microservices vs SOA](-   Faster deployments, higher rate of tests being run after each commit.) and that somehow strikes how microservices outweigh SOA in terms of fast deployment.

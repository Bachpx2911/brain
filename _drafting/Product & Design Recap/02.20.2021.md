We had already finished the first part of this training session, the software development process which helped all team members have an overview of building a product. To get a better insight into startup CEO/founders' incentive, we continued to learn about where ideas come from, why people want to bring an idea into reality, and what a good idea is.

In the kickoff meeting before initiating a project, we often hear that the incentive of making a product is to realize a problem or problems of a group of users and they (startup) want to solve them. In another way, the idea usually comes from human needs or demands. In order to better understand human needs, we went through some popular frameworks that are used in many successful products.

**Maslow's hierarchy of needs**

Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a motivational theory in psychology comprising a five-tier model of human needs, often depicted as hierarchical levels within a pyramid. From the bottom of the hierarchy upwards, the needs are: physiological (food and clothing), safety (job security), love and belonging needs (friendship), esteem, and self-actualization.Needs lower down in the hierarchy must be satisfied before individuals can attend to needs higher [up.In](http://up.In) general, humans are made of 3 main components: **physical**, **psychological** and **consciousness**, Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a ladder to bring certainty for these components.

In business, after analyzing target customers, Maslow's hierarchy of needs is applied to define needs to make suitable products or strategies.

In facts, people don't always desire certainty, since too much certainty leads to boredom. Thus, people also desire change, adventure and variety to feel alive. Variety and certainty are very much connected to each other. They sit on either side of a scale that needs to be in constant balance. When we have too much certainty we reach a level where we are running on automatic. We look for a change to break up the monotony and bring some interest. This is where innovation comes from. As people live a boring life, keep doing things in their daily routine, they tend to do a lot of things to bring change and interest into their lives, some of them are innovating and creating new things.

**Seven deadly sins**

The seven deadly sins, also known as the capital vices, or cardinal sins, is a grouping and classification of vices within Christian teachings. Behaviors or habits are classified under this category if they directly give rise to other immoralities. According to the standard list, they are pride, greed, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony, and sloth, which are contrary to the seven heavenly virtues. These sins are often thought to be abuses or excesses of natural faculties or passions (for example, gluttony abuses the natural hunger for nourishment).

-   Lust: It is usually thought of as intense or unbridled sexual desire, lust could also mean other forms of unbridled desire, such as for money or power.
-   Glutton: is the excess and overconsumption of anything to the point of waste.
-   Greed: also known as avarice, cupidity, or covetousness. Greed is applied to an artificial, rapacious desire and pursuit of material possessions.
-   Sloth: refers to a peculiar jumble of notions, dating from antiquity and including mental, spiritual, pathological, and physical states. It may be defined as absence of interest or habitual disinclination to exertion.
-   Wrath: can be defined as uncontrolled feelings of anger, rage, and even hatred. Wrath often reveals itself in the wish to seek vengeance.
-   Envy: can be described as a sad or resentful covetousness towards the traits or possessions of someone else.
-   Pride: it is identified as dangerously corrupt selfishness, the putting of one's own desires, urges, wants, and whims before the welfare of other people.

We often hear CEOs share that their products provide some values for users such as, convenience, optimization, sharing, connectivity ... In essence, what they do is to fulfill one or some of 7 needs above. For example, Instagram is not only a social media based on photo sharing, where users share their photos and show off their lifestyles; it also satisfies the needs of envy and pride of humans.

**Skandhas - the five aggregates**

**Skandhas** means "heaps, aggregates, collections, groupings". In Buddhism, it refers to the **five aggregates of clinging**, the five material and mental factors that take part in the rise of craving and clinging. They are also explained as the five factors that constitute and explain a sentient being’s person and personality.

The five aggregates or heaps are: **form** (or material image, impression, **sensations** (or feelings, received from form), **perceptions**, **mental activity** or formations, and **consciousness**.

-   Form: matter, body or "material form" of a being or any existence.
-   Sensation: sensory experience of an object. It is either pleasant, unpleasant or neutral.
-   Perception: sensory and mental process that registers, recognizes and labels (for instance, the shape of a tree, color green, emotion of fear).
-   Mental activity: all types of mental imprints and conditioning triggered by an object. Includes any process that makes a person initiate action or act.
-   Consciousness: Awareness of an object and discrimination of its components and aspects.

The five aggregates are often interpreted in the later tradition as an explanation of the constituents of person and personality. According to this interpretation, in each skandha – body, sensations, perceptions, mental formations and consciousness – there is emptiness and no substance.

Applying this framework to product design, a product not only meets the needs of users, but also must satisfy all human components, both physically, mentally, and emotionally, and consciousness. During the journey of users to accomplish their task, besides emotion, we should evaluate all components, and transform the negative factors into the positive ones.

These frameworks is used to analyze human needs. Basically, ideas come from responding to human needs to bring back some value (material or non-material). Before an idea comes into play, it is important to carefully measure and evaluate the responsiveness to the needs and its value.

**What is Micro-frontend?**

An architectural style where independently deliverable frontend applications are composed into a greater whole

**Benefits**
- Smaller, more cohesive and maintainable codebases
- More scalable organisations with decoupled, autonomous teams
- The ability to upgrade, update, or even rewrite parts of the frontend in a more incremental fashion than was previously possible
- Easier maintenance: Keeping frontend repositories small and specialized allows them to be more easily understood, and this simplifies long-term maintenance and testing.

**Thoughts**
When it comes to architecture design, Monolith is fater in early iteration, but it gets slower over time. In monolith, changes require a full build. Thats a pain in the ass with big teams. 

SOA is basically the same with microservices, provides scaling opportunity. It serves multiple purposes, independently.

Imo, when it comes to architectural decision, it should depends on the phase - software development phase. In short, does the codebase small enough to manage as a whole, or should it be divided into smaller blocks?
